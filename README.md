# Electric Vehicle Range Prediction

This project utilizes the Electric Vehicle Population Data, sourced from the official US government website - the US Department of Licensing [Data.Gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data). The dataset comprises data on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing, highlighting a snapshot taken on November 10, 2020, and last updated on January 19, 2024.

**Project Goal**
The primary aim of this analysis is to develop a regression model capable of accurately predicting the electric range of electric vehicles (EVs) based on various features such as model year, make, and model. By achieving this goal, the project intends to:

- Provide consumers with insights into factors that influence electric vehicle range, aiding them in making informed decisions when purchasing EVs.
- Offer industry insights into competitive analysis and trends over time.
**Data Overview**
The dataset contains 166,800 entries and spans 17 columns, offering a comprehensive look at the EV population within Washington State.

**Methodology**
The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development phases. Through these steps, the project identifies key factors affecting EV range and builds a predictive model to estimate it accurately.

**Findings and Implications**
- Consumer Guidance: The project highlights important features influencing EV range, guiding potential buyers in their decision-making process.
- Industry Insights: Provides valuable information on competitive trends and developments within the EV market.
